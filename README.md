### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a teacher from Hangzhou Dianzi University, passionate about inspiring studentsâ€™ creativity and motivation [@HDUHelp](https://github.com/hduhelp). Through exploring the joy of collaborative development on GitHub organization, I hope to lead students to improve their skills and teamwork ability through practice.

In my GitHub profile, you can discover some of the ongoing projects we are working on, including:

- web applications developed through team collaboration
- Several data analysis projects
- [OpenSDK](https://github.com/hduhelp/api_open_sdk) of web projects

These projects all involve actual coding and collaborative development, which is a great opportunity for students to put what they have learned into practice. During this process, I also share my experience and knowledge in software engineering, hoping to be helpful to all participants.
